                   <p> The essential amino acids are Leucine, Isoleucine, Valine, Tryptophan,Lysine,Methionin,Threonine, and Phenylalanine. These amino acids are acquired through nutrition since the body isn't able to create these essential amino acids. Amino Acids help decrease fatigue and may also increase resistance to fatigue while working out. It is common for people who do weight training, Fat loss programs or sports training to take amino acids. A 2-1-1 ratio  of Leucine, Isoleucine, and Valine is recommended.</p>
